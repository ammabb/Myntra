Our team, "SheCode Ninjas" has developed a prototype showcasing features that Myntra can implement to enhance user interaction and engagement. 
1. Influencer Collaboration (BUZZ) : We introduced a Buzz section where the rising influencers and the well established influencers and live events are highlighted, allowing customers to comment and like their favorite influencers and stay updated on fashion and beauty events.
2. Blogs (User-Generated-Content) : We also created a Blogs section featuring user-generated content, encouraging community participation. The main motive of this section is to emerge as fashion magazine where the audience who prefer reading can be attracted.
3. Gaming : We added a Gaming section with a spinning wheel, enabling customers to win discount coupons once daily with one time spin.
4. We added an "Affiliate Marketing" feature where users can log in and share Myntra products on social media. Whenever someone clicks on the shared link and buys the item, the user who shared the link earns money.
5. Furthermore, we proposed a solution to increase user interest from various social media platforms to Myntra by integrating in-post links from Instagram. By incorporating clickable links in Instagram advertisements, users can explore different products shown in the photos and be redirected to similar product pages on Myntra. This approach aims to captivate customers' interest from Instagram and drive their engagement on the Myntra app.

Our prototype includes the following Tech-Stacks:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. Tailwind CSS
